Hyperbole provides various events that can be tied to specific `Action`s. Up to this point, we've only used them via the higher-level `View`s like `button` and `search` . They can also be used directly. In this example we use `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`

Remember it is better to use Atomic CSS to provide immediate feedback whenever possible. If used improperly, too many mouse events could make the app unresponsive.
