__Beginners__ - It uses some advanced Haskell features, and requires using [Effectful](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effectful). If you are learning Haskell, I recommend using [Scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) instead. While it doesn't provide any interactivity, it will be much easier to trace everything that is going on and will help you learn faster.

__Offline and Low-Latency Apps__ - Some apps really do need to interact instantly using complex client-side logic. Hyperbole has a [[/javascript]] API to layer in client-side code when you need it, and one could certainly clone Gmail or Facebook. However, if your team is big enough to hire separate Javascript developers, it's time to call yourself a "backend expert" and write an an API using [Servant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant) instead.
